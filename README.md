## Documentation

## Installation

Add this to your Gemfile:

    gem 'redditkit', '~> 1.0.1'

Or install it directly:

    gem install redditkit

## Getting Started

RedditKit.rb is structured closely to the wonderful [Octokit.rb](https://github.com/octokit/octokit.rb) and [Twitter](https://github.com/sferik/twitter) gems. If you're familiar with either of those, you'll feel right at home here. You can find the [project's documentation on the RedditKit website](http://redditkit.com/redditkit.rb/).

RedditKit.rb is used through either the `RedditKit` module, or `RedditKit::Client` objects, like so:

**Module usage:**
```ruby
RedditKit.sign_in 'username', 'password'
RedditKit.user_agent = 'MyRedditBot/1.2 (+http://www.reddit.com/user/username)'
subreddits = RedditKit.subscribed_subreddits
```

**Instance method usage:**
```ruby
client = RedditKit::Client.new 'username', 'password','MyRedditBot','1.2'
subreddits = client.subscribed_subreddits
```

Using RedditKit.rb at the module level allows you to use a single account without having to keep track of RedditKit::Client instances. Working at the instance method level makes it possible to use multiple accounts at once, with one client object per account.

> RedditKit.rb doesn't have any built-in rate limiting. reddit's API rules require that you make no more than 30 requests per minute and try to avoid requesting the same page more than once every 30 seconds. You can read up on the API rules [on their wiki page](https://github.com/reddit/reddit/wiki/API).

### Authentication

```ruby
client = RedditKit::Client.new 'username', 'password'
client.signed_in? # => true
```

## More Examples

**Fetch a user and check their link karma:**

```ruby
user = RedditKit.user 'samsymons'
puts "#{user.username} has #{user.link_karma} link karma."
```

**Subscribe to a subreddit:**

```ruby
authenticated_client = RedditKit::Client.new 'samsymons', 'password'
authenticated_client.subscribe 'ruby'
```

**Upvote the top post in a subreddit:**

```ruby
posts = authenticated_client.links 'programming', :category => :top, :time => :all
authenticated_client.upvote posts.first
```

**Send private messages:**

```ruby
authenticated_client.send_message 'How are you?', 'amberlynns', :subject => 'Hi!'
```

## Pagination

Some RedditKit.rb methods accept pagination options and return `RedditKit::PaginatedResponse` objects upon completion. These options allow you to, for example, limit the number of results returned, or fetch results before/after a specific object.

`RedditKit::PaginatedResponse` forwards its enumeration methods to its `results` array, so you can iterate over it like you would with a standard array.

``` ruby
paginated_response = RedditKit.front_page

paginated_response.each do |link|
  # Do something with each link.
end
```

## Configuration

You can configure various aspects of RedditKit.rb's operation, including its default API endpoint and user agent, by setting attributes on `RedditKit::Client`.

**You should set your user agent to the name and version of your app, along with your reddit username. That way, if you ever have a buggy version of your app abusing the API, the reddit admins will know who to contact.
```ruby
#Option 1
MY_BOT_VERSION = 1.7
client = RedditKit::Client.new 'myRedditUserName','password','myBotName',MY_BOT_VERSION
puts client.user_agent
# yields "myRedditUserName/1.7 (+http://www.reddit.com/user/myRedditUserName)"

#Option 2
client = RedditKit::Client.new 'myRedditUserName','password'
client.user_agent_name = 'myBotName'
client.user_agent_version = MY_BOT_VERSION
#This also works with the module usage pattern
RedditKit.sign_in 'myRedditUserName','password'
RedditKit.user_agent_name = 'myBotName'
RedditKit.user_agent_version = MY_BOT_VERSION

#Option 3
client = RedditKit::Client.new 'myRedditUserName','password'
client.user_agent='myCustomAgentString/0.4 (+http://example.com/contact/info.html)'
#This also works with the module usage pattern
RedditKit.sign_in 'myRedditUserName','password'
RedditKit.user_agent='myCustomAgentString/0.4 (+http://example.com/contact/info.html)'
```

### Debugging

Because RedditKit.rb is built atop [Faraday](https://github.com/lostisland/faraday), you can modify its middleware stack to add new behaviour. This is particularly handy for debugging as you can turn on Faraday's response logger.

```ruby
RedditKit.middleware = Faraday::Builder.new do |builder|
  builder.use Faraday::Request::UrlEncoded
  builder.use RedditKit::Response::RaiseError
  builder.use RedditKit::Response::ParseJSON
  builder.use Faraday::Response::Logger
  builder.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
end
```

### Writing Tests

Tests assume the presence of a `.env` file at the project's root. This file should contain the following three environment variables:

* `REDDITKIT_TEST_USERNAME` The username of a reddit account dedicated solely to testing.
* `REDDITKIT_TEST_PASSWORD` The password for the reddit account.
* `REDDITKIT_TEST_SUBREDDIT` A subreddit for which the provided reddit account has admin privileges. This subreddit should be also be dedicated to testing as the test suite will run many different methods on it, creating & deleting various resources.

## Requirements

Ruby 1.9.3 and Ruby 2.0.0 are officially supported.
